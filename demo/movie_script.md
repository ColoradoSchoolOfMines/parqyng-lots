[Sumner]            Finding parking in busy areas can be a very daunting task
                    during peak hours at Mines. Searching for parking can take
                    upwards of one hour!

                    The Mines ACM Xilinx Hackathon team built a solution to this
                    problem.

                    Introducing: Parqying!

                    Parqying is a multipurpose capacity tracking system designed
                    to alleviate the stress of parking.

[Daichi]            A network of modular traffic flow detection nodes allows the
                    client to tailor the Parqying system to their needs.

                    Each node connects to a central server to create a
                    comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the parking situation.
                    These nodes are powered by the the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 platform,
                    and utilize the latest FPGA technologies.

[Sumner]            Users can use the Parqying web application to check the
                    status of all of the parking lots and determine which one
                    has parking spots left.

                    Parqying: Never look for parking again!
